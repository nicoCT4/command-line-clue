Detective's Initial Report:

During the morning roll call, The Artist reported odd footprints leading to the houses.

This seems like a good place to start our investigation. Remember to:
- Use 'cd' to move between locations
- Use 'ls' to list the contents of each location
- Use 'cat' to read any text files you find
